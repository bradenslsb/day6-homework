                    Rick Sanchez, a depressed, alcoholic, abusive, madman (who also happens to be a genius scientist with the ability to travel
                     through dimensions) returns to his daughter Beth's life after two decades of being silent between the two. He finds her married
                      to an incompetent, pathetic man named Jerry, and the couple has two teenage kids. Summer, the oldest girl, is a rebellious teen
                       looking to have more friends at school, and Morty, the youngest child and a boy, is an anxious, quiet, and sweet kid. Rick makes 
                       Morty his sidekick and takes him on hilarious Interdimensional adventures, causing poor Morty to become steadily more miserable
                        due to Rick's insane, abusive, and careless additude.
